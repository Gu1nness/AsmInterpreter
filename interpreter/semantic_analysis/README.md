# Semantic Analysis

Semantic analysis or context sensitive analysis is a process in compiler construction, usually after parsing,
to gather necessary semantic information from the source code. It usually includes type checking, or makes sure
a variable is declared before use which is impossible to describe in the extended Backusâ€“Naur form and thus not
easily detected during parsing.
